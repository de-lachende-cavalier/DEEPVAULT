***What is DEEPVAULT?***

        DEEPVAULT is a password manager prototype exclusively for Tor users meant to offer higher security and privacy 
        than any password manager now in existence without sacrificing the portability of password managers directly 
        accessible by your browser.
        I made it as a University project, in an attempt to spin up a very secure and private web app (and to get an
        idea as to what that entails, both at a design and at the implementation level).
        (Also, I felt like learning Django.)

***Technical details***

        DEEPVAULT is mostly made with Django, so written in Python.
        It also uses NodeJS, mostly to handle cryptographic keys and keep them away from the business logic of the main 
        Django code, in an effort to mimic a sort of LSM (a bit overcomplicated, i know...).

***Contributing***
        
        Even though DEEPVAULT is not yet production ready (as specified above, it's mostly in its prototype stage and I have no
        plans to make it production ready yet) any contribution/tip is still very welcome :D
