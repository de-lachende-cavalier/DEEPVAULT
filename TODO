DEEPVAULT v2.0 -> currently a work in progress!!:
- Write it in Rust
- Two components: local and remote
- Local component -> CLI app that starts the authentication with the server, stores all the necessary data LOCALLY!
- Remote component -> A server that stores only the passwords and relative data with very strong encryption
=> It avoids a lot of complications and useless boilerplate like HTML, JS and CSS; the remote server only becomes responsible for one thing and has more flexibility in carrying out its purpose, so the overall architecture is greatly simplified thus easier to mantain.

- start laying out some specs (JUST DO IT)
- accumulate the technologies that will enable the whole thing
